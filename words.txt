young: This portrait feels distant, and less personal than the older portrait of Fee. Based on the paleness of his skin, he almost seems like a blank canvas, ready for a life of fighting. This portrait seems more like a testament to the pre-Abolitionist Fee - before he began his fight for African American freedom.:|:
old: This portrait feels more like one of a man that has already lived a full life; tanned skin, wrinkled features, and a look that seems to communicate a life or fighting and loss. He seems very prestigious, but not in a necessarily negative way. This portrait makes Fee look like he has earned his prestige.:|:
young: This man looks focused on the task at hand. Unerringly determined, though maybe without a clear path to proceed. It also appears a bit abstracted, not as if it is an actual person, but an idea. The direct eye contact gives an impression of personal attention, while the nondescript features serve as a (not completely successful) universalizing feature. An embodiment of the gaze.:|:
old: This man seems nearly dismissive. He is sure of himself at the detriment of pushing others away. He is too focused on power.:|:
young: in here he appears with blue eyes while in the other one they're brown:|:
young: I feel threatened:|:
old: Still feel threatened:|:
