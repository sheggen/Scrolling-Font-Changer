			<p>When a portrait is hung on a wall, it implies that the subject possesses a level of ownership over the immediate space (or, perhaps, the entire building). As a result, it can be impossible to enter a room without encountering the figure and the legacy they represent. This proposal endows viewers with agency to determine how they coexist with a group of portraits and the space they occupy. </p>

			<p>Each of these four portrait is attached to a movable section of wall, which places control in the hands of viewers. For example, a visitor could choose to turn a wall section around, effectively hiding an image from the gallery. Alternately, the walls can be pushed into different configurations, offering visitors a chance to experiment with the arrangement of space. </p>

			<p><b>We invite you to use the metal bars to push and pull these panels to create your own viewing experience.</b> If you would like some help moving the sections, we are happy to assist. Just call the Art Office at 859-985-3658 and someone will come to help.</p>
