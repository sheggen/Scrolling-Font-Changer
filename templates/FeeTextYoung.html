		<p>Viewers are often positioned to imagine that a portrait is not just a momentary snapshot of an individual, but also, a rendering that should capture their essence and legacy. As a result,  portraits have features that impact the ways audiences relate to them including the age of the sitter, the clothes theyâ€™re wearing, and the objects that surrounded them. </p>

		<p>Despite their marked differences, both of these portraits depict the same man - Berea College founder John G. Fee. The image on the right was painted during his lifetime while the portrait on the left was created 15 years after his death.</p>
